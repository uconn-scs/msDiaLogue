\title{Filtering NA's post-imputation}
\usage{
filterNA(dataSet, minProp = 0.51, by = "cond", saveRm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataSet}{The 2d data set of experimental values.}

\item{minProp}{A scalar (default = 0.51) specifying the minimum non-missing
proportion required for a protein to be retained.}

\item{by}{A string (default = "cond") specifying how coverage is evaluated.
\itemize{
\item \code{"cond"}: The non-missing proportion for a protein must be at
least \code{minProp} within each condition. Proteins failing in any condition
are filtered out.
\item \code{"all"}: The overall non-missing proportion across all samples
must be at least \code{minProp}.
}}

\item{saveRm}{A boolean (default = TRUE) specifying whether to save removed data to
current working directory.}
}
\value{
A filtered 2d dataframe.
}
\description{
Remove proteins with NA values.
}
\details{
If proteins that do not meet the imputation requirement are removed, a .csv file is
created with the removed data.
}
