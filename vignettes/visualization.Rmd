This module provides a variety of options for getting a global view of your
data, making comparisons, and highlighting trends.


<div class="note">
**Note:** Data visualization is most effective when illustrating a point or
answering a question you have about your data, not as a means to find a
point/question. </div>


There is a wide variety of plotting options in **msDiaLogue**. What plots are
possible depend on what data you have and what analyses have been run. See below
for more details of individual plot types.


## Preliminary


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide'}
## load R package
library(msDiaLogue)
## preprocessing
fileName <- "../tests/testData/Toy_Spectronaut_Data.csv"
dataSet <- preprocessing(fileName,
                         filterNaN = TRUE, filterUnique = 2,
                         replaceBlank = TRUE, saveRm = TRUE)
## transformation
dataTran <- transform(dataSet, logFold = 2)
## normalization
dataNorm <- normalize(dataTran, normalizeType = "quant")
## imputation
dataImput <- impute.min_local(dataNorm, reportImputing = FALSE,
                              reqPercentPresent = 0.51)
## filtering
dataImput <- filterNA(dataImput, saveRm = TRUE)
## analysis: MA
anlys_ma <- analyze.ma(dataImput, ref = "50pmol")
## analysis: Empirical Bayes moderated t-test
anlys_modt <- analyze.mod_t(dataImput, ref = "50pmol", adjust.method = "none")
## analysis: PCA
names(dataImput)[sapply(dataImput, function(col) length(unique(col)) == 1)]
dataPCA <- dataImput[, colnames(dataImput) != "ALBU_BOVIN"]
anlys_pca <- analyze.pca(dataPCA, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
## analysis: PLS-DA
anlys_plsda <- analyze.plsda(dataImput, method = "kernelpls",
                             center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
## other useful: Sort conditions
dataSort <- sortcondition(dataSet)
```


## Boxplot


```{r}
visualize.boxplot(dataNorm)
```


## Heatmap


The package offers two options for plotting the heatmap.


+ Option 1 utilizes the source package `pheatmap`, capable of plotting the
dendrogram simultaneously. It is the default choice for heatmaps in this package.


```{r fig.height=6}
visualize.heatmap(dataImput, pkg = "pheatmap",
                  cluster_cols = TRUE, cluster_rows = TRUE,
                  show_colnames = TRUE, show_rownames = TRUE)
```


When protein names are excessively long, it is recommended to set
`show_rownames = FALSE` to view the full heatmap.


+ Option 2 use the source package `ggplot2` to generate a ggplot object but does
not include the dendrogram.


```{r fig.height=6}
visualize.heatmap(dataImput, pkg = "ggplot2")
```


In a heatmap, similar colors within a row indicate relatively consistent values,
suggesting similar protein expression levels across different samples.


## MA plot


### Examples


```{r}
visualize.ma(anlys_ma$`100pmol-50pmol`, M.thres = 1)
```


where `M.thres = 1` means the M thresholds are set to -1 and 1. The scatters are
split into three parts: up regulation (M > 1), no regulation (-1 $\leq$ M
$\leq$ 1), and down regulation (M < -1). Additionally, the warning message
"Removed 32 rows containing missing values" indicates that there are 32 proteins
with no regulation.


If the input `dataSet` is the whole list `anlys_MA`, **msDiaLogue** will produce
individual subplots corresponding to each comparison.


```{r}
visualize.ma(anlys_ma, M.thres = 1)
```


### Details


An MA plot visualizes the differences between measurements taken in two samples,
by transforming the data onto M (log ratio or fold change) and A (mean average)
scales. The MA plot puts the variable M on the y-axis and A on the x-axis and
gives a quick overview of the distribution of the data. Most proteins are
expected to show little variation, and so the majority of the points will be
concentrated around the M = 0 line (no difference between group means).
Typically, points falling above $abs(1)$ are highlighted.


<div class="note">
**Note:** As the MA plot does not include any measure of statistical
significance, it cannot directly identify which proteins are statistically
differentially expressed. </div>


An MA plot, short for "M vs. A plot," which uses two axes:


+ M axis (vertical): Represents the fold change, usually on the logarithm base 2
scale, or the ratio of the expression levels, between two conditions. It is
calculated as:
$$M = log_2(X/Y) = log_2 X - log_2 Y$$
+ A axis (horizontal): Represents the average intensity of the two conditions,
calculated as:
$$A = \frac{1}{2}log_2(XY) = \frac{1}{2}\left[log_2(X)+log_2(Y)\right]$$


Most proteins are expected to exhibit little variation, leading to the majority
of points concentrating around the line M = 0 (indicating no difference between
group means).


## Rank abundance distribution plot (Whittaker plot)


The rank abundance plot shows proteins ranked by abundance to visualize
distribution patterns and highlight specific proteins across conditions or
replicates.


```{r fig.height=6}
visualize.rank(dataImput, listName = "POLK_HUMAN",
               facet = c("Replicate", "Condition"))
```


## Histogram of fold changes and p-values for test


### Examples


```{r}
visualize.test(anlys_modt$`100pmol-50pmol`)
```


If the input `dataSet` is the whole list `anlys_modt`, **msDiaLogue** will
produce individual subplots corresponding to each comparison.


```{r fig.height = 6}
visualize.test(anlys_modt)
```


### Details


The function `visualize().test` can be applied to any test output. It generates
two useful plots: a histogram of fold changes across the analyzed proteins and a
histogram of p-values. The majority of proteins are expected to show very small
change between conditions, so the fold change histogram will have a peak at
around zero. For the p-values, most p-values are expected to be non-significant
(above 0.05). Depending on the strength of the treatment effect, there may be a
peak of p-values near 0.


## UpSet plot


The UpSet plot is a visual representation that helps display the overlap and
intersection of sets or categories in a dataset. It is particularly useful for
illustrating the presence or absence of elements in combinations of sets.


```{r}
visualize.upset(dataSort)
```


This plot reveals that 42 proteins are shared by 50pmol, 100pmol, and 200pmol,
while only 3 proteins are shared by 100 pmol and 200pmol, but not with 50pmol.


## Venn plot


The Venn plot is another graphical representation of the relationships between
sets. Each circle represents a set, and the overlapping regions show the
elements that are shared between sets.


```{r}
visualize.venn(dataSort, show_percentage = TRUE,
               fill_color = c("blue", "yellow", "green", "red"),
               saveRes = TRUE)
```


where `saveRes = TRUE` refers to the data containing logical columns
representing sets in Venn plot information will be saved as a .csv file named
*venn_information.csv* in the current working directory.


In the example above, 50pmol, 100pmol, and 200pmol groups share 42 proteins.
Notably, 3 proteins are exclusively found in the 100pmol and 200pmol groups.


## Volcano plot


### Examples


```{r}
visualize.volcano(anlys_modt$`100pmol-50pmol`, P.thres = 0.05, F.thres = 1)
```

If the input `dataSet` is the whole list `anlys_modt`, **msDiaLogue** will
produce individual subplots corresponding to each comparison.

```{r}
visualize.volcano(anlys_modt, P.thres = 0.05, F.thres = 1)
```


### Details


A volcano plot is a graphical representation commonly used in proteomics and
genomics to visualize differential expression analysis results. It is
particularly useful for identifying significant changes in extensive data.
It displays two important pieces of information about differences between
conditions in a dataset:

+ Statistical significance (vertical): Represents the negative log10 of the
p-value.

+ Fold change (horizontal): Represents the fold change.


## Scree plot


One way to help identify how many PCs to retain is to explore a scree plot. The
scree plot shows the percentage of variance explained by each PC.


```{r}
visualize.scree(anlys_pca, type = c("bar", "line"),
                bar.color = "gray", bar.fill = "gray", line.color = "black",
                label = TRUE, ncp = 10)
```


where `label = TRUE` adds information labels at the top of bars/points, and
`ncp = 10` sets the number of dimension to be displayed.


## Score plot / graph of individuals


### Example


```{r}
visualize.score(anlys_pca, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.level = 0.95, label = TRUE)
```


### Details


The primary PCA plot of individual data visually represents the distribution of
individual observations in a reduced-dimensional space, typically defined by the
PCs. The x and y axes of the PCA plot represent the PCs. Each axis corresponds
to a linear combination of the original variables. Individual data points on the
PCA plot represent observations (e.g., samples) from the original dataset.
Points that are close to the origin (0, 0), are close to the "average" across
all protein abundances. If sufficient samples are present, the plot will also
produce a 95\% confidence ellipse, as well as a centroid (mean for each group
provided), for each groups (condition) provided.


## Loading plot / graph of variables


### Example


```{r}
visualize.loading(anlys_pca, label = TRUE)
```


### Details


This plot will be more useful if your analyses are based on a relatively small
number of proteins. It represents the association, or loading of each protein on
the first two PCs. Longer arrows represents stronger associations.


<div class="note">
**Note:** Proteins that are weakly associated with PC1 or PC2 may still be
highly correlated with other PCs not being plotted. Consult the scree plot (and
other available methods) to determine the appropriate number of PCs to
investigate. </div>


## Biplot of score (individuals) and loading (variables)


The biplot includes individual and variable plots. Again, with a large number of
proteins, this plot can be unwieldy.


```{r}
visualize.biplot(anlys_pca, ellipse = TRUE, ellipse.level = 0.95, label = "all")
```


## VIP score plot


This combined plot pairs a VIP-score chart on the left with a heatmap on the
right. The left panel shows each variable as a dot at its VIP score from PLS-DA.
Higher scores indicate greater importance for class separation. The right panel
uses colored tiles to show each top variable's average abundance across
conditions. So you can instantly see which variables matter most for class
separation and how they behave in each condition.


```{r fig.width=9}
visualize.vip(anlys_plsda, comp = 1, num = 10, thres = 1)
```
