Description: Offers simple tools to manipulate and investigate mass spectrometry (MS)
    data from data independent aquistion (DIA) experiments. The package is designed 
    to make effective statistical methods for DIA easy and accessible to all researchers.
    Specific tools include: filtration, transformation, normalization, 
    differential abundance estimation, and visualization.
